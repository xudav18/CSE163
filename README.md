# CSE163 Final
### Jimmy Guo & David Xu

This repository contains code for our final project for CSE163 20sp.

To run the project:
Clone this public GitHub to obtain all code and csv files, etc. that will be utilized.
Ensure you have the latest version of Python, and install the following libraries
in whatever fashion you find best (pip install ..., etc.):
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- plotly.express
- matplotlib
- sklearn

Two classes will be used to generate all graphs we use, and they print out the MSE:
- model_visualizations.py (generates graphs to research questions 1 and 2)
- optimal_candy.py (generates graphs to research question 3)

Note that the dataset is called "candy-data.csv" and we've taken the liberty of removing some
non UTC-8 characters that were originally present (cannot be done via code) and also the existing images
in this repository are the graphs that we've generated by running the two classes and are used in our report.
